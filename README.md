# Web team recruitment task - Junior React developer 2020
Simple book store application. User can:
- see all available books in-store (fetched from the API)
- search available books by their title
- add a book to a cart
- see that he added a book to cart (a buy button is disabled)
- remove a book from a cart
- see total price 
- see discount
- see the final price to pay 


## Discout 
Some books are part of a special offer (have set property `specialOffer` to `true`). Every three books on promotion added to cart make the lower price book free
